# Taichi training journal

This is a tiny minimalistic personal taichi training journal. This tiny app uses currently only mock data, so it will not save your data, but it is still interactive.

Taichi is a martial art. As a beginner you start learning very slow motions to understand the principles, so that you can increase your speed later. Taichi is about movement transformations from very slow to fast, softness to strength, and endurance. It is about ballance and conscious movement not only during training, but also in your daily life.
